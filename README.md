The maps present intuitive answers to questions such as:

- Who are the flag states?
- Where most trees are deforested to ship out?
- When the rhythm of gold reserve breathing in & out between London and ZÃ¼rich?
- Which country exports most agri & food after the US?
- What natural resource in periodic table does Japan export?
- Why Norway is not joining EU?
- How is Hong Kong being the infusion tube of Chinese economy?

## FAQ

### Gross vs Net import/export

Gross import/export value is the actual import/export values of trading goods per category.

Net import/export value is the value of deficit/surplus trading goods per category. Each category of trading goods can only be counted as import or export. For instance, a country imports 400B and exports 50B crude oil, the net value only counts 350B crude oil as imports. 

The overall summation of all categories *in net* deficit/surplus per country is constantly equal to *in gross* deficit/surplus, no matter how granular the classification of trading goods is calculated. 

### HS2 vs HS4 vs HS6

HS2 is 2 digits classification code of trading goods, showing as the color of each block. HS4 adds 2 more digits of details to HS2; HS6 adds 2 more digits of details to HS4.

The more detailed granularity of classification, the larger net import and net export values respectively. When comparing net import/export values per category, the more details is not necessarily adding more information. Supposing we classify trading goods to extreme granularity per product serial number, ISBN or EAN, the net value would be almost same as gross value, thus calculating net value is mearly useless anymore. 

Comparing to HS4, HS6 adds marginal accuracy, while extra verbosity of lengthy terminologies of most goods. For general readers who are not professional at customs, HS4 descriptions are succinct and more relevant to common sense than HS6, but there are exceptions, i.e., HS4 malt extract majorly means infant milk formula; HS4 photo lab equipment generally means semiconductor lithography system.

### Inflation vs Actual trade growth

The measure of trading values takes into account the time period's inflation rate. So actual trade growths or recessions are correctly represented.

Cumulative inflation is adjusted as 2020 US dollar values based on https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/

### Groups of countries

Groups of countries or regions are often referred to by a single term (word, phrase, or abbreviation). The origins of such terms include political alliances, intergovernmental organizations, business market areas, and mere colloquialism.

Trade maps of contemporary [Country groupings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_groupings) can be generated with the script. It is also possible to generate arbitrary groups for instance: 

- [Island-Landlocked-Coastal](https://xdqc.github.io/world-trade-map/Islands_Landlocked_Coastal.html)

- Former [Axis-Anglo-Commie-TheRest](https://xdqc.github.io/world-trade-map/Axis_Commie_Anglo_Rest.html)
